# DKATALIS X JAGO INTERNSHIP CHALLENGE PROBLEM 1

This is a ReactJS + Vite template that provides a minimal setup to get React Working with HMR and ESLint Rules. 

Because it's assumed that I can use the ReactJS framework to help with this solution I chose to use ReactJS. It is also because JavaScript, unlike C++ cant really simulate a CLI so I figured that I should just make one 

This project uses:
Node as its Runtime
ReactJS as the main framework
Jest (and technically babel) for testing
ESLint for code quality through enforced linting rules

# HOW TO RUN THIS PROJECT

```npm i```

```npm run dev```

# RUNNING UNIT TESTS

```npm i```

```npm run test```

# ASSUMPTIONS



# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
